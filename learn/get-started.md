## What is Smart Artists?

Smart Artists is both a protocol and a marketplace for a special kind of Stellar Assets. The protocol takes care of issuing these Assets (or saNFTs) and executing all the earning layers behind saNFTs. On the other hand, the marketplace is where you will be able to participate in the protocol.

The protocol is completely decentralized thanks to Stellar Turrets and operates through [its smart contracts](../technical/our-smart-contracts.md).

By using Smart Artist's protocol, you will be able to share the ownership and earn passively on your saNFTs through multiple layers ([layer-0](layer-0.md), [layer-1](volume-pools-layer-1.md), [layer-2](layer-2.md), [staking](staking.md)).

## Why Smart Artists?

The NFT market is at its peak right now and will continue to grow, we are using the Stellar Network as technology to create an **intersection between standard NFTs and dynamic shareable assets**, converging in saNFTs (smartartistsNFTs).

**Smart Artists is a DeFi protocol** (Decentralized Finance protocol) meaning that it works in a Decentralized way without having a central authority that controls the protocol. All the updates we will do, need to be first **approved by the users** who use our protocol, and anyone can propose updates. This means that you have control over your own saNFTs and how you earn from them.

## How do Users Update the Smart Artists Protocol?

No centralized entity has access to Smart Artists' protocol account (thus its smart contracts), this means that our development team cannot update, fix, or add contracts. But updating is important in every app that we use, what works today might not work in the near future. This is where [our governance model](governance-model.md) kicks in, enabling the protocol to be updated and changed in a decentralized way.
