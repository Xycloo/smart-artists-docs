## Intro

#### Stellar DeFi powering a marketplace for non-standard NFTs


Hi **Stellar Lover**! ðŸ‘‹


Standard NFTs are great, but lack of a dynamic component:
> You buy one, and sell it at a higher price when it gets more "*valuable*"

What about:
> You buy one, and **continuosly** earn *as* it gets more "*valuable*"

That's where SmartArtistsNFTs, or <span style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span> come into play.
