# Staking

Staking is a well-known functionality in most DeFi protocols. Usually, a user stakes a token in exchange for voting tokens and earns interest. In our protocol, staking is completely different.

In the saProtocol, **staking and governance/voting** are not related. Rather, staking will be yet another way of earning from saNFTs, by in fact staking them. This feature will only be available on the BETA version of the protocol, but in the following paragraph, you will understand what staking will probably look like at launch.

### How It Works

The idea is fairly simple, users will be able to stake their saNFTs in public pools and share the earnings with other pool members.

#### A high-level description of the flow

1. User stakes their saNFT in a public pool (according to the pool's acceptance criteria)
2. The profits of all the saNFTs in the pool get will be accumulated and distributed to all the users in the pool depending on the percentage of ownership of the staked saNFT at the moment of staking.



This is again, a very experimental feature and we have not yet tested it, but we are willing to introduce it. If you have any suggestions for us on staking, let us know on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/8wqG97gDrZ)!
