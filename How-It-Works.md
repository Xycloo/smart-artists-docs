### Artists Upload Their saNFTs

The Artists will be able to upload their <span style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span> to the marketplace. There currently is no dashboard as SmartArtists is still in development stage. 


If you wish to be one of the first Artists to be able to upload the first <span style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span>, drop a message on my Twitter. I'll let you know when I'll be uploading the first beta NFTs.

### Buying a saNFT

Users will then be able to aquire these assets for as much as they want through the Marketplace(<span style="color:#FFAF52">**buy offer**</span>, yes you can chose for how much you'll be buying a <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span>, you'll see why in the "How To Earn" page).

*The marketplace is currently under development, but soon the first beta <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span> will be available on the production environment. To get the latest updates join the [Stellar Community Fund discord server](https://discord.gg/JYuczS2v).*

Users will be able to get <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span> with either [Albedo](https://albedo.link/) or [XBull wallet](https://xbull.app/).

When a user buys a <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span>, they will become part of that <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**'s</span> network, and reward all the owners with their **buy offer** (this will be clearer once you read the "How to Earn" page). 

##### The How to Earn page will extend and explain the whole buy offer, and rewarding the owners concept.

After reading this page, you will have an understanding of how Smartarists works. From the basics (how to earn, what you are buying, etc), to the more advanced features (pool accounts, unique nfts marketplace, reparations, etc).

### What will you be buying?

> Pay attention here, this is one of the most confusing aspects of the project if you are used to buying standard NFTs.

When buying a smartartistsNFT (<span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span>), you will mainly be doing 4 things:
1. [Get the <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span> issued to your wallet](#get-the-sanft-issued-to-your-wallet).
2. [Get a unique *"buyer NFT"* associated to your wallet]().
3. [Reward the Artist and the previous owners with your `buy_offer`]().
4. [Fund the pool account with a % of your `buy_offer`]().

Each of these 4 steps is a key part of the project in terms of dynamicity, and will be explain in detail in the next sections.

### Get the saNFT issued to your wallet

<span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span>s don't have a price, you can decide for how much XLM you want to buy them: that will be your *buy_offer*. What is the logic behind this? Let's find out!

When you get a saNFT issued to your wallet, the Stellar network will store on-chain the following information:

> *User* bought *testSaNFT* for a *buy_offer* of ***n*** XLM

This info will then be used to build an on-chain database of owners with how much each of them owns (their *buy_offer*) compared to the total of XLM that have been spent on that saNFT. 

For example, if a total of 900XLM have been spent on *testSaNFT*, and you bought it with a *buy_offer* of 100XLM, you would own 10% of *testSaNFT*'s ownership network as:
- total XLM on *testSaNFT* are 900 + your buy offer (100XLM) = 1000XLM
- you own 100XLM of 1000XLM, that's exactly the 10%

The more you own in the ownership network of a saNFT, the more you earn as you'll discover in the [Reward the Artist and the previous owners with your `buy_offer`]() section. **As you can see, the higher your *buy_offer* is, the more you'll possibly earn. That's why each buyer can decide their *buy_offer***.

### Get a unique "buyer NFT" associated to your wallet

Besides entering in the saNFT's ownership network (as seen in the previous section), you will also get the
