Let's briefly see how SmartArtists works. But I recommend giving a read to [the Litepaper](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEwY4NM08I/7qM9l7DxXhn6DqJugaj1yg/view), it summarizes everything you need to know about this platform.

### Artists Upload Their saNFTs
The Artists will be able to upload their <span style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span> to the marketplace. There currently is no dashboard as SmartArtists is still in development stage. 

If you wish to be one of the first Artists to be able to upload the first <span style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span>, drop a message on my Twitter. I'll let you know when I'll be uploading the first beta NFTs.

### Buying a saNFT

Users will then be able to aquire these assets for as much as they want through the Marketplace(<span style="color:#FFAF52">**buy offer**</span>, yes you can chose for how much you'll be buying a <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span>, you'll see why in the "How To Earn" page).

*The marketplace is currently under development, but soon the first beta <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span> will be available on the production environment. To get the latest updates join the [Stellar Community Fund discord server](https://discord.gg/JYuczS2v).*

Users will be able to get <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span> with either [Albedo](https://albedo.link/) or [XBull wallet](https://xbull.app/).

When a user buys a <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**</span>, they will become part of that <span style="font-size:1rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFT**'s</span> network, and reward all the owners with their **buy offer** (this will be clearer once you read the "How to Earn" page). 

##### The How to Earn page will extend and explain the whole buy offer, and rewarding the owners concept.
