# Welcome


Hi **Stellar Lover**! ðŸ‘‹

If you are looking for a project that leverages Stellar Smart contracts to create a <span style="color: #CB6CE6">**Decentralized marketplace for out-of-ordinary NFTs**</span>, you are in the right place!

Standard NFTs are great, but lack of a dynamic component:
> You buy one, and sell it at a higher price when it gets more "*valuable*"

What about:
> You buy one, and **continuosly** earn *as* it gets more "*valuable*"

That's where SmartArtistsNFTs, or <span style="font-size:1.3rem;color:#8C52FF">**saNFTs**</span> come into play.
